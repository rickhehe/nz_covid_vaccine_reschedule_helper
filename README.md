# NZ Covid Vaccination Rescheduler

This is my first web scrapping project. I used this to reschedule the first shot for myself, my wife, and a bunch of friends. No need for this now, but it's great practice for me.

I learned a lot from [John's channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnWatsonRooney). Thanks to him.
